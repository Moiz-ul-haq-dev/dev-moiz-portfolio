          As an undergraduate from UET Lahore with a degree in computer science, my expertise lies in full-stack website developmentâ€”a skill set I have diligently cultivated over the past several years. Through freelancing, I have actively contributed to numerous projects, specializing in both MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, Node.js) and MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stacks. Proficient in technologies such as AngularJS, React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, I possess a comprehensive understanding of how to leverage these tools to construct dynamic and engaging websites. My capabilities extend to both front-end and back-end development, allowing me to create responsive and interactive web applications.

          In addition to my web development process, I bring a keen interest in game/Virtual Reality development, particularly within the Unity game engine. Experienced in crafting a variety of games, my focus lies in developing web-based single-player and multiplayer experiences. My Unity expertise encompasses 2D and 3D game/VR environment development, physics simulation, animation implementation, and user interface creation. Several of my game projects have successfully reached app stores and online platforms.

          Furthermore, I am well-versed in WebGL, a JavaScript API for rendering interactive 3D and 2D graphics in web browsers without the need for plug-ins. My proficiency extends to utilizing libraries like three.js and Babylon.js for 3D graphics and animations, as well as Phaser for 2D game development. This knowledge allows me to craft browser-based 3D games, interactive simulations, and other engaging graphics. My dedication to creating immersive and enjoyable digital experiences is evident in my diverse skill set and project portfolio.
